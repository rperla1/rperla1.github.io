  <h1>Crafting graphics for merging artists and newly released albums!</h1>
  
    <p>I have taken several graphic design courses while studying at UW-Madison, and I love exploring 
    new artistic and creative outlets. I primarily design graphics for EMMIE Magazine, the leading music 
    magazine on campus. And below you can find some of my designed graphics.</p>
    
  <h2>Here are some of my recent works:</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Instagram graphic for Jaden Smith's CTV: Volume 3 album</li>
      <li>Performance poster for Dumbo Gets Mad at Der Rathskeller</li>
      <li>Digital sketch of Fleet Foxes' Shore album cover</li>
    </ul>
