  <h1>Some random thoughts of mine for y'all!</h1>

  <h2> Movies:</h2>
  
  <h4>Freaky Friday</h4>
    
    <p>The Oscars are so pretentious, aren’t they? Because if they weren’t, they never would have 
    overlooked Jamie Lee Curtis’s performance as a teenager trapped in her mother’s body in this 
    hilarious version of what was already a pretty great concept. Lindsay Lohan actually does beautifully
    as her mother as well, but Jamie Lee Curtis slays me. When the teenager-trapped-in-mom’s-body tries to
    read something and has to trombone it, Curtis says “Whoa, she’s blind!” in one of the funniest line 
    deliveries ever, and that’s just one of the many scenes in this movie that she completely nails. I 
    actually believe there’s a teenager in there. Believe it. And this realistic acting makes it all the
    more poignant when they whip out the schmaltz and actually make me cry. It’s a great movie about 
    understanding each other. Period.</p>
    
  <h4>Ratatouille</h4>
    
    <p>If you’re sensing a Disney obsession here, that’s because I’m in the DVD club. And incidentally,
    I adore the movie montage before Disney movies now where they play the fantastic score from Kevin 
    Kostner’s Robin Hood. It gets my Hollywood eyes all starry. And Ratatouille is just so cute and 
    culinary. It doesn’t exactly make me want to be a cook, but it makes me appreciate them very, very 
    much. I’m so glad some people cared to turn our plain animal instict to eat things into an actual art.
    If there were only people like me in the world, ingredients would never have come together properly.
    Heck, we probably never would have peeled a banana.</p>
    
  <h2>Music:</h2>
  
  <h4>Positions, Ariana Grande</h4> 
  
  <p>Thoughts on Ariana's new album? I loved her singles earlier this year and was hoping we'd get 
  something more in line with Dangerous Woman. Instead, this feels like the B sides of Thank U Next, 
  an album that always felt overrated to me. The best song is probably "Motive" and even that was just 
  nice. Weirdly short songs and she just sounds bored a lot of the time. On "Off the Table" especially, 
  The Weeknd is killing it but she's just hitting the notes with no soul. Mariah would have nailed that
  track. I know it's just first listen, but anyone else feeling the same way? The title track is fine and
  there are a couple other decent songs, but I was hoping for something better. None of these songs are
  anywhere near as good as "Stuck With U" or "Rain On Me."</p>
  
  <h4>The Idiot, Iggy Pop</h4>
  
  <p>Iggy Pop's The Idiot is a masterpiece, IMO. It might as well be co-credited as Iggy Pop and David 
  Bowie, who played keyboards on it and helped co-write the bulk of the songs with Iggy. He also played
  keyboards on Pop's subsequent Idiot tour, relishing the opportunity to blend into the background as an
  anonymous bandman for once (something he'd attempt again with Tin Machine). It's also important as it 
  bridges Bowie's 1976 LP Station to Station to the "Berlin Cycle" that would start with 1977's Low. While
  expanding on the Station to Station's mechanical funk, The Idiot dabbles in krautrock and electronic 
  influences that would be explored further on Low.</p>
  
  <h2>Shower thoughts:</h2>
  
   <ul>
      <li>Maybe plants are really farming us, giving us oxygen until we eventually expire and turn into
      mulch which they can consume.</li>
      <li>As a kid my parents taught me to not believe everything I see on TV, now I have to teach them
      to not believe everything they see on Facebook.</li>
      <li>When you say 'Forward' or 'Back', your lips move in those directions.</li>
      <li>My dog understand several human words. I don’t understand any dog barks. 
      He may be smarter than me.</li>
      <li>In order to fall asleep, you have to pretend to be asleep.</li>
    </ul>
