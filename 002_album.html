  <h1>Recently released album reviews!</h1>
  
  <h2>Alicia, Alicia Keys:</h2>
    <p>Alicia Keys’ engaging seventh album, Alicia, plays to the singer’s strengths, exuding warmth and cautious optimism 
    while emphasizing her masterful balladry. Released on September 18, 2020, Alicia is an enriching blend of empathy, positivity, 
    and self-knowledge with some fine collaborations that enliven the soul singer’s most personal set thus far.<p>
    
    <p>Keys has described the album as “genreless,” and while that’s not technically true, I definitely see where she’s coming from. 
    Alicia moves easily between moods and styles, from the disco throwback “Time Machine,” to the moody R&B ache with Tierra Whack on 
    “Me X 7,” to the slinky reggae of “Wasted Energy” with Tanzanian singer Diamond Platinumz. As Alicia glides from throwback funk to
    dewy reggae and languid R&B to folky soul there’s a sense that Keys cares more about creating a mood here than maintaining any one
    particular sound. This amounts to a largely enjoyable set that finds the silken-voice singer deftly blending genres, both classic
    and contemporary.<p>
    
    <p>This is an album that shimmers with passion and sincerity from start to finish. “We’re all in this boat forever, and we’re 
    sailing towards the future and it’s alright,” Keys sings on “Authors Of Forever,” a balmy gem with a hint of 1980’s Lionel Richie to
    it. Combined with a lack of uptempo cuts, this consistent mood gives the album an impressive sense of cohesion. Only “Love Looks Better,”
    a bombastic pop-soul ballad produced by Adele and Beyoncé collaborator Ryan Tedder, comes close to sticking out.<p>
    
    <p>Keys showed a more socially conscious side on her last album, 2016’s Here, and she continues to engage politically on Alicia. 
    Co-written with Ed Sheeran, “Underdog” contains an unpretentious and affecting shout-out to young teachers and student doctors as well
    as “single mothers waiting on a check to come.” More powerful still is “Perfect Way To Die,” a timely ballad written from the perspective
    of a grieving mother whose son has been gunned down by cops. When Keys sings, “just another one gone / And they tell her to move on,” it’s
    a casually damning condemnation of America’s inadequate response to racism and police brutality.<p> 
    
    <p>Rather than pull all the air out of the album’s close, and sound big and empowered, Keys is humbler and humbled with “Good Job.”
    The album ends earnestly with a piano ballad dedicated to parents, teachers and other ordinary people merely trying to get through the day.
    It could have come off trite and condescending from a woman who sold 16 million copies of her debut album Songs In A Minor when she was just
    20-years-old, but somehow it doesn’t. Like most of Alicia, it’s warm, well-meaning and primed to provide some much-needed musical healing.<p> 

    <p>Alicia goes further, freakier, funkier, quieter and jazzier down that gritty path, with experiments in melodic soul and impressionistic
    lyrics whose emotions go beyond unsettled romance. Rather than rely on her past musical tropes, Keys lets her nuanced, versatile voice do
    the talking like never before.</p>

  <h2>Tickets To My Downfall, Machine Gun Kelly:</h2>
  
    <p>With his roguish blue-collar image and Hot Topic wardrobe, Machine Gun Kelly always seemed more lightweight than his self-serious 
    alternative rap music suggested. Machine Gun Kelly made his name as a Cleveland rapper known for his high-adrenaline singing style and
    infamous tattoos. But on Tickets To My Downfall, he tries a new gambit that works surprisingly well, dabbling with the 90s and early-2000s
    pop-punk. Tickets To My Downfall adds more degrees of climb to his already impressive trajectory, with less “Oh, the humanity,” and more, 
    “Woah, the profanity.”<p>
     
    <p>This album swells with a heart of pure Warped Tour pop-punk nostalgia with Machine Gun Kelly’s usual rapping firmly put on the back burner.
    In his opener, “title track,” Machine Gun Kelly draws his brat-rock energy from a genuinely damaged school of emo-informed hard knocks. He 
    sings with snarls and goes on to list the drugs he takes to dull his pain, a common theme for the young singer, as sugar-sharp guitars chase 
    him from slashing verses to an engagingly whiny chorus.</p>
    
    <p>“My ex’s best friend,” the third single off the album which features blackbear, favors this spot-on rush of fizzy melody, sticky choruses
    and caffeine-bomb energy. Blackbear, a similarly brooding, tattooed Instagram ex-boyfriend, writes wallowing R&B from the perspective of the
    lover. Thus, his vengefulness makes him a deeply unsympathetic narrator. Moreover, “my ex’s best friend” paired with the speedy “WWIII,” anthemic
    “kiss kiss” and energetic “title track,” make you feel as if you had fallen over and landed at a barbecue with all your best friends and loads of
    beer. There’s probably someone skateboarding nearby. You might even get a kiss.</p>
    
    <p>And one can't fail to mention the influential producer and imaginative collaborations that made this album flourish. From drummer and producer
    Travis Barker, who throws in a couple of clever musical flourishes around the margins, to Halsey's glorious firepower shouts on the jauntily 
    heartbroken high point "forget me too," Tickets To My Downfall never gets bogged down as the energy keeps going.</p>

    <p>But don’t forget to pay attention to the darker lyrics, as the strain and stress fuelled in his metaphors come into a bit more focus with
    “I used a razor to take off the edge, jump off the ledge they said / Take the lazer, aim at my head and paint the walls red, I said,” and “If I
    were a painter I’d be a depressionist.” It’s an open diary with pouring vulnerability and honesty that fills the whole album. Confessional and 
    unflinching, at once a sting in the pop-punk good times, but all the more original for it. Perhaps, then the person wondering when this will all
    come crashing down is Machine Gun Kelly himself.<p> 
    
    <p>Despite its “I’m a big drunk mess” lyrical monomania, Tickets To My Downfall is the product of a guy who’s found a fresh lease on life by 
    inserting himself inside a new musical tradition. From angst breakup jams that rock hard to bittersweet operatic ballads anchored by heavy 
    basslines, Machine Gun Kelly finally found both a genre and producer as brazenly allergic to subtlety as he is. Even the cover of Machine Gun Kelly
    looking defiant and tortured holding a pink guitar near an empty pool reveals this album's emotional center and musical appeal.<p>
    
    <p>In a certain sense, Machine Gun Kelly’s rebirth as a pop-punk revivalist might be the ultimate form of fan service—the aesthetic is far more 
    suitable for his rock and Warped Tour following. Thematically, Tickets To My Downfall is hardly a departure from Machine Gun Kelly’s past work,
    but the new surroundings and production lighten his music considerably. With Travis Barker on his side, he might win over the skeptics accusing
    him of trend-hopping, but the best part of Tickets To My Downfall is that he doesn’t take the whole endeavor too seriously.</p>
